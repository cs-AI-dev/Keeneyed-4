## Reporting a Vulnerability

### System Security Vulnerabilities  
If you find a flaw in the KE4 system's security (i.e. the creation of a backdoor, encryption bypassing, etc.), you can report it to [the Issues page](https://github.com/cs-AI-dev/Keeneyed-4/issues) and head your issue with "SECURITY ISSUE". The developers will shut down any live servers and get to releasing a patch as soon as possible; expect at most a 1-week delay.

### System Simulant Vulnerabilities
If you find a way for any product of the system to begin to cause damage in a way you can't control, IMMEDIATELY shut down your copy of the system. Even if you exempted out of Section 8.2 of the EULA, you may after shutting down your copy of the system invoke Article 8.2.2 or Article 10.1 of the EULA. A patch for the simulant security vulnerability will be released in at most a month.
