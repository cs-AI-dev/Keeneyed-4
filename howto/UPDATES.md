# Keeneyed-4 AGI and Simulation Engine Update Log

## 11/25/2021 - Version 4.1.0.0 BETA
> **WARNING: BETA VERSION**.  
> This version will likely have bugs and will be unstable.  
1.0.0 B adds a functional simulation engine. Documentation will come regarding how to use the engine as well as how to set up a parseable project.  
This release also adds a simple-to-use neural networking engine. Currently only perceptrons (feedforward neural networks) are available. Documentation on that is also coming.  
Preformatting and presets for both the neural networking and simulation engine will arrive soon, probably in 4.1.1.x. Patches for individual programs will be released if the bugs are put in the issues section.
