# Keeneyed-4
## An AGI engine heavily rewritten but based on the KE3 system.  
This is the *fourth* iteration of my artificial general intelligence software. It's not actually my first attempt at an AI; the original CS AIs all failed, there were 5 of those, and I wrote several spinoff tests that worked decently well, but this is my first fully functional AGI engine.  

Not only does this engine incorporate the science-fiction concept of AGI, but it also includes a simulation engine with which to allow your AGI to understand the three-dimensional world even if you don't have incredibly complex animatronica to plug it into. Information on how to work both the AGI and simulation engine can be found under "howto", as well as information on how to install this package. If you're reading this inside the package folders, you can go to the [Github page](https://github.com/cs-AI-dev/Keeneyed-4) and check there.  

### How to Install
Simply download a `tar` or `zip` file and execute the `... /master/install.py` Python file. Running the installer on versions of Python other than 3.8.3 might not work right, so be sure you have the correct interpreter installed and are using it.

### How to Use
See the up-and-coming [Wiki](https://github.com/cs-AI-dev/Keeneyed-4/wiki) for more on how to use the engine, as well as commands that you can use to work it.

### In the Next Update:
- Easy environment installation.  
- KE4 preformat progress.
