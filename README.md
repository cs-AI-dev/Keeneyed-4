# Keeneyed-4
### An AGI engine heavily rewritten but based on the KE3 system.  
This is the repository for the Keeneyed-4 artificial general intelligence agent engine. The engine allows for the instantiation of AGI agents into any Python program. I've been working for a while on trying to compile the Python into C and then into machine code; then you could use it in any C-based program.  
As of right now, the AGI agents are recurrent neural network-based. The agents can be instantiated as follows-
### The `ArtificialGeneralIntelligence()` Class
This module provides a simple object that allows for the instantiation of intelligent agents.
