# Contributing to the Keeneyed-4 AGI/Simulation Engine
As of right now, contributions are strictly limited to AGI preformats for accomplishing tasks.  

If you've come up with a code, preformat, simulation, additional feature, or anything else related to the engine that you think the community would find useful, you can [add a Feature Request](https://github.com/cs-AI-dev/Keeneyed-4/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=) which'll be reviewed by the Developers. Once we have, if your code meets our Contribution Standards (defined below), it'll be added to the repository's Contributions folder!
